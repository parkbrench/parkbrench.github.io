                        Hi! If you're reading this, you got our marriage announcement. We marry on <span class="has-text-weight-semibold">Feb. 12, 2021</span> in <span class="has-text-weight-semibold">Graz</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since we can't celebrate together in person, we want to share some photos with you and we also have a gift request.
                    </p>

                    <p> üì∑  <a class="has-text-info has-text-weight-semibold" href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RJFWtSZ4hyoq3Tko8" target="blank">Photos</a>: from before, after, and maybe also during the wedding ceremony</p>

                    <p> üéÅ  <span class="has-text-weight-semibold">Gift Request</span>: The date of our marriage is a <a class="has-text-info" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome" target="_blank">palindrome</a> if you write it as <code>dd.mm.yyyy</code>. To remember this day, we'd love to get a palindrome from you. :)(:</p>

                    <p>
                        You can interpret what a palindrome is for you very loosely. A word, a story, a photograph, a sound, ... The most important thing is that it comes from you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please mail these to us by post or by email, if you can by the next similar palindrome date (Feb. 22, 2022). &lt;3

        <li id='q6' class="title is-4 mt-3">Will you have a party?</li>
        <p>At the moment, we don't have plans for a party because of coronavirus and the short notice, but we are hoping to put together an event for sometime in the next few years where our family and friends can meet.</p>
        <li id='q3' class="title is-4 mt-3">Will there be pictures?</li>
        <p>Yes, there will be some pictures posted 
            <a class="has-text-info has-text-weight-semibold" href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RJFWtSZ4hyoq3Tko8" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <li id='q5' class="title is-4 mt-3">Do you have a wedding registry?</li>
        <p>No, at the moment we don't. If you're interested, here are <a class="has-text-info" href="items.html" target="blank">things we want in our daily lives</a>.</p>
        <li id='q8' class="title is-4 mt-3">When will you be back in the US?</li>
        <p>Hard to say. We're trying to get Sadie a residency in Austria so we could live here together. We'd like to travel to meet family and friends in the US as soon as that's possible and responsible.</p>
        <li id='q9' class="title is-4 mt-3">Can we come to Austria to visit you?</li>
        <p>Hard to say as well. You're very welcome to visit, but it's currently hard to get in because of the worldwide health situation. We hope it'll be different soon!</p>
        <li id='q7' class="title is-4 mt-3">How and when did you meet?</li>
        <p>We met first on GitHub, which is a code hosting website and incidentally also where you're currently reading this page :) Sadie read an article about two Google Homes talking to each other that Martin wrote on Medium. She checked out his GitHub and clicked on follow. This was some time in 2016. Sadie didn't shed another thought about it. In the summer of 2017, Martin found Sadie among his (very few) GitHub followers and checked out her code projects. He found some of her project ideas, writing, her website, her music, her twitter, and many beautiful things among all that. So he listened to her songs for a while, and later decided to write her an email. They started writing to each other. In late 2017, Martin was on the west coast of the US and decided he'd fly to Chicago to visit Sadie. They met in person on the 4th of December 2017, Sadie cooked taco shells on an open flame and served it with salt and oil, they brought one of Sadie's cats to the vet together, and Martin said "wow I also really like you in real life!"</p>
