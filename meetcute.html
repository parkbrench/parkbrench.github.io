        <h2 class="title is-2">Meet Cute</h2>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_cute#:~:text=In%20film%20and%20television%2C%20a,%2C%20humorous%2C%20or%20cute%20circumstances." target="_blank">"Meet cute" wikipedia page</a></p>

        <p>This is a longer version of how we met, since it got too long on the other page.</p>

        <p>We met first on GitHub, which is a code hosting website and incidentally also where you're currently reading this page :) Sadie was researching about chatbots and found an article about two Google Homes talking to each other that Martin had written on Medium. She checked out his GitHub and clicked on Follow. We think this was sometime in 2016. Sadie didn't shed another thought about it. In the summer of 2017, Martin found Sadie among his (very few) GitHub followers and checked out her projects. He found some of her ideas, writing, her website, her music, her twitter, and many beautiful things among all that (that's nice of you, thanks, Martin). So he listened to her songs for a while, and in the fall decided to write her an email saying something like, "I worry I am cyber-stalking you and I started working on one of your project ideas so I'm emailing you to see if you want to be friends or if I should go away." </p>

        <div id="box">
            <span id="firstemail" class="blurme" style="background-size: cover;">   
            <img src="assets/images/firstemail.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>
        <div id="box">
            <span id="secondemail" class="blurme" style="background-size: cover;">   
            <img src="assets/images/secondemail.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>
        <p>So we started writing to each other. We talked about books and music and religion. At some point Sadie sent Martin a book.</p>

        <div id="box">
            <span id="bookemail" class="blurme" style="background-size: cover;">   
            <img src="assets/images/bookemail.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>
        <p>In late 2017, Martin was on the west coast of the US and asked Sadie if he could visit her in Chicago.</p>

        <div id="box">
            <span id="visitemail1" class="blurme" style="background-size: cover;">   
            <img src="assets/images/visitemail1.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>

        <div id="box">
            <span id="visitemail2" class="blurme" style="background-size: cover;">   
            <img src="assets/images/visitemail2.png" alt="" /></span>
        </div>
        <p>In retrospect it was bad timing for Sadie, so maybe she should have proposed another time to meet, but Martin wasn't deterred by her lack of punctuation.</p>

        <p>We met in person on the 4th of December 2017. Sadie warmed up some corn tortillas on the open flame on the stove and served it with salt and oil and Martin was very impressed. Then we brought one of Sadie's cats to the vet together, and Martin said "wow I also really like you in real life!" and we got to know each other and started dating soon after.</p>
